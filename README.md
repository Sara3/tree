tree
====
. Include a main program to read a series of numbers from an input file and insert them into a binary search tree. 
Then, allow the user to repeatedly look up chosen values in the tree. 
The program will respond to each of the user’s choices by indicating whether it is found in the tree. 
Let the value zero serve as a sentinel for the user’s input.
